# Exploratory-Analysis-of-FIFA-18-Dataset
This project aims to take a deep dive into ratings of 18000 real soccer players by conducting exploratory analysis to identify meaningful relationship between a playersâ€™ valuation, overall rating and age. Furthermore, the project includes building a regression model to predict the overall rating of a player based on several underlying factors. The metrics that would classify this project as a success would be diagnosis of data through exploratory analysis to identy hidden associations between relevant attributes.  The scope of this project is limited to the above mentioned metrics with elclusion of advanced analytical techniques such as cluster analysis in future due to time constraints, complexity of data and scalability of model.
